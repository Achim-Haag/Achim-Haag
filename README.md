# My First C Program

## What this project was made for
Intention of this project was learning programming in the C language.

## Where this program comes from
The program is a sample published in c't, a german computer journal, but I will expand it depending on my needs.<br>The [original source can be found in github too](https://github.com/607011/wordle-c)

## What to expect
- nice little quiz
- experience in C programming
- some insights to Windows memory management
- overall experience in Visualstudio Code and Github

## What I have done till now
- typed in source code, formated in "my way"
- made modifications
    - character hints not dependend on guessing word of wordlist
    - "#" for fast exit
    - getopt.c integration for parsing commandline parameters

## What will come
- Details for pointers
- Output regarding Windows memory management (?)
- ... tbd ...

## What you don't need to compile
- .gitinore = exclusion list for directories and files not to process with git
- *.asm = Assembler language listings generated by C-Compiler - just to show what the CPU does with your C program ;-)
- vc140.pdb = Debugging information generated from C-Compiler (if you like to find my errors :-)
- .vscode = Folder with Visualstudio Code definitions for building (compiling), launching and debugging this project in Windows
    launch.json = Enables Visualstudio Code to compile this project without executing VSC from VS developer command prompt
    tasks.json = Compiles all .c programms in this folder at once (Ctrl-Shift-B to build the .exe)
